                               The Hot Air Balloon Festival is celebrated once a year on the second Festival of Lights after Buddhist Lent, and lasts for four days. Traditionally, it is the festival in which the natives pay homage at the Sulamani Temple by releasing decorative balloons towards the heavens. The paper balloons are between 4, 5 and 6m high, and are decorated on the outside with colourful lanterns made of cellophane. Lights are attached to the lanterns, giving the balloons a different pattern. The hot-air balloon rises quickly because of the flame heating the air inside the balloon - a 3 to 5m long trail with various fireworks being dragged along behind which constantly explode. Take a look at how the small children's balloons are made, along with the competition between the different groups, for whom it is all about the most beautifully decorated and the highest ascending balloon.

                            This festival, also known as Tazaungdaing Full Moon Festival is held in Shan State in November. People crowd Taunggyi to witness the magnificent view of the hot-air balloons in the sky. During the day, the baloons that fly are pagoda-themed whereas at nighttime, visitors get to see animal-shaped balloons that are unique. Besides hot-air balloons, locals light candles and fireworks which are also released as a part of the celebration. People participate in charity work to honour this festival. They offer food to monks and give donations to them.
